# Tsuki Tasks
Tsuki Tasks is a tiny to do list application which helps keep track of the tasks you're currently doing. It doesn't aim to do much more than that.

"Tsuki" is the Japanese pronounciation of "Moon" or "Month" and originally was the code name for the "Luna replacement" WPF theme used by this application.
